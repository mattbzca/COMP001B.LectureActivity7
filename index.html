                <h2>What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided in your learning process?</h2>
                <p>⮞ Over the last 8 weeks, learning how concepts were applied in concrete examples aided in my understanding. Specifically, the websites that display how different CSS grids look or how Bootstrap/Third-Party Library syntax works.</p>
                <h2>What would you change about the course?</h2>
                <p>⮞ I would add a section about CSS Transforms because of how widely used it is in modern web design. Transforms come in several types that can be modulated in an endless amount of ways.</p>
                <h2>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course?</h2>
                <p>⮞ I learned what I expected to learn, but I would probably need to practice and read more on how CSS grids works in practical scenarios.</p>
                <h2>What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered in the past?</h2>
                <p>⮞ Of the listed concepts, I learned new/better ways to implement CSS Grids and Bootstrap, including how to use other third-party libraries syntax. Other than those, I have encountered the rest of the concepts, albeit more sufficiently.</p>
